    This plot shows the training and validation loss over epochs. The training loss curve indicates how well the model is learning on the training data, while the validation loss helps to monitor its generalization on unseen data. 
    A consistent gap between the curves or an increasing validation loss while training loss continues to decrease might indicate overfitting. This furthermore indicates that the model was stopped after roughly 35 epochs to prevent overfitting.
